# ChadNext ✨ 

ChadNext is a quick starter template for your Next.js project. It provides a minimal setup with all the basic features you need to build your next project, including a UI component library, authentication, database integration, analytics, and more.

## Motivation 🚀

If you have an idea and want to quickly build a Proof of Concept (PoC) or Minimal Viable Product (MVP) to test the market, ChadNext can help you overcome several pain points:

- Finding a high-performing full-stack framework
- Finding a beautifully designed, accessible, and customizable modern UI library
- Finding an easy and simple authentication solution
- Finding a tool to interact with the database effortlessly
- Finding a fast and reliable cloud-hosted database service
- Finding a user-friendly platform for deploying your application
- Creating a robust codebase architecture
- Implementing code quality assurance tools

By addressing these pain points, ChadNext saves you time and effort, providing a solid starter template for building performant apps with an excellent developer experience.

## ChadNext Stack 🛠️

ChadNext utilizes the following technologies:

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - A full-stack React framework to build high-performing apps with zero configuration.
- [Shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) - A beautifully designed, accessible, and customizable component library made with **Radix UI**, **Tailwind CSS**, and many battle-tested libraries like **React Table**, **React Hook Form**, **Zod**, etc.
- [Auth.js](https://authjs.dev/) - An easy and simple authentication solution.
- [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) - A simple, cool type-safe ORM.
- [Postgres](https://vercel.com/postgres) - Postgres is one of the best SQL databases. ChadNext is using **Vercel Postgres**, which is scalable and secure by default.
- [Analytics](https://vercel.com/analytics) - To get privacy-friendly, real-time traffic insights, ChadNext is using **Vercel Analytics**.
- [Deployment](https://vercel.com/) - ChadNext is using Vercel for deployment, which helps you focus on development only, handling all the complexity of deployment, including automatic preview for every commit and branch.
- [Linting](https://eslint.org/) & [Formatting](https://prettier.io/) - ChadNext uses Eslint to keep the code consistent and Prettier to keep the code readable. It also uses Husky to ensure all the linting and formatting before every commit.
- and Of course, Type safety with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

By using **[Vercel](https://vercel.com/) as a PaaS**, ChadNext reduces the pain of finding and adding solutions for the database, analytics, and deployment. We can focus only on development.

So, now you can build and deploy the product of your idea quickly and analyze the market.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 🤔

**Q: How is ChadNext different from other templates?**

A: ChadNext provides a comprehensive set of features, including a UI component library, authentication, database integration, analytics, and deployment. It offers a quick start with a minimal setup, leveraging the power of Next.js, a full-stack React framework. TypeScript ensures type safety, and linting and formatting tools maintain code consistency and readability. I didn't find any template combining all these together. That's why I connected the dots and made ChadNext.

**Q: Why isn't a specific feature or tool included in ChadNext?**

A: ChadNext aims to provide a lightweight template with essential features. Additional features and tools can be customized and added based on project requirements. The flexibility allows developers to choose and integrate their preferred tools or libraries according to their specific needs and preferences. ChadNext encourages modular development practices, enabling easy addition or removal of features as the project evolves.

**Q: Why it has no state management tool?**

A: With Nextjs 13, you would hardly feel the neccesity of a state management library. Even if you need any, feel free to add one you prefer. [Zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand) or [Jotai](https://jotai.org/) is hgihly recommended.
